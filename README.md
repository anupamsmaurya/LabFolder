# Lab Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can add lab notes in textarea and search keyword withing the stored notes.
Using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store all data in browser memory.

Use `yarn start` to run the app locally.

## Pending Tasks

Few known TODOs:

### Test Cases

Planned few unit test cases.

### Highlight matched words

Highlight exact and similar words with different corresponsding colors

### Use `useMemo()` hook

For same input `useMemo()` can be used for memoised value. But need to take care of case when user adds new notes while searching.
